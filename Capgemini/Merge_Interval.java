// 30. Merge Intervals:
// Problem: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

// Input:
// Intervals: [[1,3], [2,6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

// Output:
// [[1,6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

// Explanation: Intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, so they are merged into [1,6]. The others remain unchanged.
